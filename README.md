Fun facts


1. I invented air.
2. I first started programming with a TI-82 and TI-BASIC when I was in high school... unless you want to call the pure HTML site I build on Geocities in 1997  "programming".
3. I started using Python in 2002 with Python 2.1.
4. I am not looking for a new opportunity, thanks for thinking of me though.
5. I am most passionate about internal developer tools so people who don't want to think about pipelines or networks or other infrastructure don't have to.
8. C is a poor first language.
9. Redis is not a persistent datastore.
10. Elasticsearch is persistent, but shouldn't be your source of truth.
11. `bash` is actually pretty nice if you upgrade your default install to Bash 4 or Bash 5. It has _associative arrays_ like modern languages.
12. The sunken cost fallacy definitely applies to software engineering. Don't be afraid to pivot if it's not working for you.
13. Sadly, I don't commit code here very often anymore. My job uses a self-hosted Gitlab instance and I rarely have time for personal code these days.
